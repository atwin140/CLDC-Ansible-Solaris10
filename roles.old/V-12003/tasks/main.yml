      A separate file system must be used for user home directories (such as /home or equivalent).
      If no result is returned, /export/home is not on a separate file system and this is a finding.
      If ZFS is used for home directories, this is not applicable.
      Procedure:
      # grep /export/home /etc/vfstab
      OUTPUT:
      ->  All systems are on ZFS

      This is NOT a finding
