      UIDs reserved for system accounts must not be assigned to non-system accounts.
      Confirm all accounts with a UID of 99 and below are used by a system account. If a UID reserved for system accounts (0 - 99) is used by a non-system account, this is a finding. 
      Procedure:
      # awk "-F:" '$3 <= 99 {print $1} ' /etc/passwd 
      OUTPUT:
      ->  {{ checkmyconf1.stdout }}
