      Global initialization files library search paths must contain only authorized paths.
      If there is an empty entry, such as a leading or trailing colon, or two consecutive colons, this is a finding. 

      If an entry begins with a character other than a slash (/), or has not been documented with the ISSO, this is a finding.

      Procedure:
      # grep LD_LIBRARY_PATH /etc/profile /etc/bashrc /etc/csh.login /etc/csh.cshrc /etc/environment /etc/.login /etc/security/environ
