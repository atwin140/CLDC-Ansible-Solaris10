      <check_content>This check applies to the global zone only. Determine the type of zone that you are currently securing.

      # zonename

      If the command output is "global", this check applies.

      Check the permission of the menu.lst file.

      On systems that have a ZFS root, the menu.lst file is typically located at /pool-name/boot/grub/menu.lst where "pool-name" is the mount point for the top-level dataset.

      On systems that have a UFS root, the menu.lst file is typically located at /boot/grub/menu.lst .  

      Procedure:
      # ls -lL /pool-name/boot/grub/menu.lst 
      or
      # ls -lL /boot/grub/menu.lst 

      If menu.lst has a mode more permissive than 0600, this is a finding.</check_content>
      <fix_text>Change the mode of the menu.lst file to 0600.

      # chmod 0600 /pool-name/boot/grub/menu.lst
