      <title>A system used for routing must not run other network services or applications.</title>
      <discussion>Installing extraneous software on a system designated as a dedicated router poses a security threat to the system and the network. Should an attacker gain access to the router through the unauthorized software, the entire network is susceptible to malicious activity.</discussion>
      <check_content>Ask the SA if the system is a designated router.  If it is not, this is not applicable.

      Check the system for non-routing network services.

      Procedure:
      # netstat -a | grep -i listen
      # ps -ef

      If non-routing services, including Web servers, file servers, DNS servers, or applications servers, but excluding management services, such as SSH and SNMP, are running on the system, this is a finding.</check_content>
      <fix_text>Ensure only authorized software is loaded on a designated router.  Authorized software will be limited to the most current version of routing protocols and SSH for system administration purposes.</fix_text>
