      The system must only use remote syslog servers (log hosts) justified and documented using site-defined procedures.
      Destination locations beginning with an @ represent log hosts. If the log host name is a local alias, such as log host, consult the /etc/hosts or other name databases as necessary to obtain the canonical name or address for the log host. Determine if the host referenced is a log host documented using site-defined procedures. If an undocumented log host is referenced, this is a finding.
