      <title>Audit logs must be rotated daily.</title>
      <discussion>Rotate audit logs daily to preserve audit file system space and to conform to the DoD/DISA requirement.  If it is not rotated daily and moved to another location, then there is more of a chance for the compromise of audit data by malicious users.</discussion>
      <check_content>Check for any crontab entries that rotate audit logs.
      Procedure:
      # crontab -l
      If such a cron job is found, this is not a finding.

      Otherwise, query the SA. If there is a process automatically rotating audit logs, this is not a finding. If the SA manually rotates audit logs, this is still a finding, because if the SA is not there, it will not be accomplished. If the audit output is not archived daily, to tape or disk, this is a finding. This can be ascertained by looking at the audit log directory and, if more than one file is there, or if the file does not have today's date, this is a finding.</check_content>
      <fix_text>Configure a cron job or other automated process to rotate the audit logs on a daily basis.</fix_text>
