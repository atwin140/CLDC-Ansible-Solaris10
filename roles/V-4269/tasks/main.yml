      <title>The system must not have unnecessary accounts.</title>

      Some examples of unnecessary accounts include games, news, gopher, ftp, and lp.

      <fix_text>Â Remove all unnecessary accounts, such as games, from the /etc/passwd file before connecting a system to the network. Other accounts, such as news and gopher, associated with a service not in use should also be removed.</fix_text>
