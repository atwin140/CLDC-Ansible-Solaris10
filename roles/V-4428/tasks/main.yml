      If the .netrc, .rhosts, .shosts, hosts.equiv, or shosts.equiv files have permissions greater than 600, then this is a finding.  (If a password entry has no home directory assigned, the root directory (/) is used as a default.)</check_content>
      <fix_text>Ensure the permission for these files is set at 600 or less and the owner is the owner of the home directory that it is in. These files, outside of home directories (other than hosts.equiv in /etc and shosts.equiv in /etc/ssh; both are owned by root), have no meaning. </fix_text>
