        The NFS anonymous UID and GID must be configured to values that have no permissions.
        Each of the exported file systems should include an entry for the 'anon=' option set to -1 or an equivalent (60001, 60002, 65534, or 65535). If an appropriate 'anon=' setting is not present for an exported file system, this is a finding.
