      System BIOS or system controllers supporting password protection must have administrator accounts/passwords configured, and no others.
      If the BIOS or system controller supports user-level access in addition to supervisor/administrator access, determine if this access is enabled. If so, this is a finding. 
      
      The system is virtual. The host's system controller is configured for access only to authorized users.
