      <title>Audio devices must have mode 0660 or less permissive.</title>
      <discussion>Globally accessible  audio and video devices have proven to be security hazards.  There is software that can activate system microphones and video devices connected to user workstations and/or X terminals.  Once the microphone has been activated, it is possible to eavesdrop on otherwise private conversations without the victim being aware of it.  This action effectively changes the user's microphone to a bugging device.</discussion>
      <check_content>Check the mode of audio devices.
