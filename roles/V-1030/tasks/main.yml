      <check_content>Examine the smb.conf file. Default locations for this file include /etc, /etc/sfw, /etc/samba, and /etc/sfw/samba.  If the system has Samba installed in non-standard locations, also check the smb.conf in those locations.

      If the hosts option is not present to restrict access to a list of authorized hosts and networks, this is a finding.
