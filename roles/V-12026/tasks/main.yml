      NIS maps must be protected through hard-to-guess domain names.
      If the name returned is simple to guess, such as the organization name, building, or room name, etc., this is a finding.

      NIS is not used in our enviroment.

      Procedure:
      # domainname
      OUTPUT:
      ->  {{ checkmyconf1.stdout }}

      This is NOT a finding
