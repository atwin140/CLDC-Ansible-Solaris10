      <title>The NFS server must have logging implemented.</title>
      <discussion>Filesystem logging, especially for NFS exported file systems, can be critical to detecting data misuse and possible hardware/system errors that may, otherwise, go unnoticed.</discussion>
      <check_content>To enable NFS server logging the log option must be applied to all exported file systems in the /etc/dfs/dfstab. Perform the following to verify NFS is enabled.

      #       share

      The preceding command will display all exported filesystems. Each line should contain a log entry to indicate logging is enabled. If the log entry is not present, this is a finding. If the share command does not return anything, then this is not an NFS server and this is considered not applicable.

      NFS version 4 does not support server logging.  Verify NFS_SERVER_VERSMAX in /etc/default/nfs.

      # grep NFS_SERVER_VERSMAX /etc/default/nfs

      If NFS_SERVER_VERSMAX is commented out or set to any value but 2 or 3, this is a finding.</check_content>
      <fix_text>Edit /etc/dfs/dfstab and add the log option to all exported filesystems. Run the shareall command for the changes to take effect.

      NFS version 2 or 3 must be forced by updating the NFS_SERVER_VERSMAX variable appropriately in /etc/default/nfs and restarting the NFS daemon.</fix_text>
