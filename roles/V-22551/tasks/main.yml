      The system must not send IPv6 ICMP redirects.
      The system must use an appropriate reverse-path filter for IPv6 network traffic, if the system uses IPv6.
      The system must not forward IPv6 source-routed packets.
      
      If the output indicates "insufficient privileges" then this requirement is not applicable.
      If the zone is not the global zone, determine if any interfaces are exclusive to the zone:
      IPv6 ICMP redirects - If the returned value is not 0, this is a finding.
      IPv6 source-routed - If the returned value is not 0, this is a finding.
      Procedure:
      # if [ $(zonename) = "global" ]
      #  then if [ -z $(dladm show-link | awk '/insufficient/') ]
      #      then ndd /dev/ip6 ip6_send_redirects | awk '/0/ {print "IPv6 ICMP redirects = 0"}'
