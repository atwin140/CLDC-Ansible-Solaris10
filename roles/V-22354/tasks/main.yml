      Run control scripts lists of preloaded libraries must contain only authorized paths.
      If there is an empty entry, such as a leading or trailing colon, or two consecutive colons, this is a finding. 
      If an entry begins with a character other than a slash (/), or has not been documented with the ISSO, this is a finding. 
      Procedure:
      # find /etc/rc* /etc/init.d -type f -print | xargs grep LD_PRELOAD
