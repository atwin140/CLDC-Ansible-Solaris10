      The TFTP daemon must be configured to vendor specifications, including a dedicated TFTP user account, a non-login shell, such as /bin/false, and a home directory owned by the TFTP user.
      If the tftp service is not installed or enabled, this check is not applicable.
      Procedure:
      # svcs tftp
      OUTPUT:
      ->  {{ checkmyconf1.stdout }}
      If a "tftp" user account does not exist and TFTP is active, this is a finding.
      Check the user shell for the "tftp" user. If it is not /bin/false or equivalent, this is a finding.
