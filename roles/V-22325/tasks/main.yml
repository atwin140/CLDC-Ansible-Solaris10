      The /etc/hosts file must be owned by root.
      The /etc/hosts file must be group-owned by root, bin, or sys.
      The /etc/hosts file must have mode 0644 or less permissive.
      The /etc/hosts file must not have an extended ACL.
      
      If the file is not owned by root, this is a finding.
