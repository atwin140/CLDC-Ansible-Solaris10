      This system's architecture is {{ ansible_architecture }}
      The system's boot loader configuration file(s) must not have extended ACLs.
      The system's boot loader configuration files must be owned by root.
      The system's boot loader configuration file(s) must be group-owned by root, bin, sys, or system.
