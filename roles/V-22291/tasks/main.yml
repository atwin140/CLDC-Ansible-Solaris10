      The system must use at least two time sources for clock synchronization.
      If the command output is not "global", this is not applicable.
      If less than two servers or external reference clocks (127.127.x.x other than 127.127.1.0 or 127.127.1.1) are listed, this is a finding.

      Procedure:
      # if [ $(zonename) = "global" ];   then grep '^server' /etc/inet/ntp.conf | egrep -v '(127.127.1.1|127.127.1.0)';   else echo "This is a zone and not applicable `zonename`"; fi
